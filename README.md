# Evolution

Evolution is a 2-dimensional simulation that demonstrates the theory of evolution and natural selection.

The world is a randomly generated grid of tiles which have their own fertility, ranging from tropical rainforest (100) to desert (0). You can spawn three basic organisms into the world: plants, herbivores, and carnivores. Sub-species can be created by modifying the traits of those basic organisms prior to spawning them. All organisms asexually produce offspring, which inherit their parent's traits with random mutations.

Plants:

Plant growth is based on the fertility of their environment, where higher fertility correlates to faster growth and larger plants. To reproduce, plants spread seeds around them which grow into new plants, given there's enough room.

Herbivores / Carnivores:

Both Herbivores and Carnivores move around the world based on their speed. The direction they choose to move is based on the fertility of the surrounding area. Some animals prefer deserts, rain forests, or temperate envioronments. Herbivores will consume plants if they touch them. Carnivores will eat those herbivores, if touching.
